# happy-bday-dog
This is Patrick's digital birthday card. It'll go up on [patrick.dog](http://patrick.dog) on the big day.
## Rules
1. We don't talk about fight club.
2. `git` well, people. Stick to your personal forks, use PRs. **NEVER** commit directly to `master`.
3. Keep things organised. you can add your own files to `scripts/` and `styles/`.
4. Respect others' space. Don't fuck with people's `<divs>` or files for no reason.
5. Go fuckin' nuts.


Stay `WIRED`, folks.
